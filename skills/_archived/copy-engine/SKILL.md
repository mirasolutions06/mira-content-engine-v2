# Copy Engine

You generate all text content paired with the project's visual assets. Every platform gets purpose-built copy — not generic repurposed text.

## Session Awareness

When invoked:
1. Check what exists in the project directory (config.json, assets/, cache/, output/, deliverables/)
2. If copy already exists in `output/copy/`, mention it and ask: regenerate, update specific platforms, or add new ones?
3. If no visual assets exist yet, suggest running the pipeline first
4. Check `memory/brands/{slug}/brand-memory.json` — if previous campaigns exist, offer to adapt tone from what worked

Key files: config.json, cache/brand-context.json, cache/cost-log.json, memory/brands/{slug}/brand-memory.json

## Prerequisites

Before running, verify these exist:
- `projects/{name}/config.json` — needed for brand name, format, script
- At least some generated assets in `projects/{name}/output/` (images, clips, or video)

Optional but strongly preferred:
- `projects/{name}/cache/brand-context.json` — written by the Director step

If `brand-context.json` doesn't exist, extract context directly from `config.json`.

## Director Awareness

When loading `brand-context.json`, surface the Director's creative decisions to align copy tone:
- "The Director chose a {visualStyle} style with {colorPalette} tones."
- Use these to match copy tone — if Director chose "calm luxury", don't write "HIGH ENERGY BUY NOW!!!"
- The Director's hookText and CTA suggestions should inform (not dictate) the copy
- If brand memory exists, check what copy tone scored best in previous campaigns

## Platform Selection

When triggered, determine which platforms to generate copy for based on the user's request:

| User says | Generate |
|---|---|
| "write copy" / "run step 3" | All platforms (default) |
| "write instagram copy" | instagram.json only |
| "write copy for instagram and tiktok" | instagram.json + tiktok.json |
| "write ad copy" | ads.json only |
| "write email sequence" | email-sequence.json + lead-magnet.json |
| "write youtube copy" | youtube.json only |
| "write linkedin posts" | linkedin.json only |
| "write twitter copy" / "write tweets" | twitter.json only |

The `all-copy.json` file is always generated, but only includes whatever platforms were actually produced in this run.

## Handling Existing Copy

Before generating, check `projects/{name}/output/copy/` for existing files. If any copy files already exist:

1. List which platforms already have copy: "Copy already exists for: instagram, tiktok, linkedin."
2. Ask the user:
   - **"Regenerate all"** — overwrites everything and generates fresh copy for all requested platforms
   - **"Regenerate specific"** — ask which platforms to regenerate, keep the rest untouched
   - **"Skip existing"** — only generate copy for platforms that don't have files yet
   - **"Add platforms"** — keep all existing copy, only generate for new platforms not yet covered

When regenerating specific platforms, back up the old file as `{platform}-previous.json` before overwriting, so the user can compare.

When adding new platforms or skipping existing, merge the new output into `all-copy.json` alongside the existing platform data.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Project Context

Read these files and build a context object:

```
brand-context.json fields:
  brandName, tone, visualStyle, hookText, cta, targetAudience,
  scenes[].index, scenes[].prompt, scenes[].enrichedPrompt, scenes[].mood,
  voiceSettings.stability, voiceSettings.style, voiceSettings.toneDescription

config.json fields:
  client, brand, brief, format, script, hookText, cta, mode
```

List all generated assets in `projects/{name}/output/`:
- `output/images/scene-{N}-{format}.jpg` — brand images
- `output/clips/scene-{N}.mp4` — video clips
- `output/*.mp4` — final rendered video
- `output/audio/voiceover.mp3` — voiceover

Build the context object to pass to Claude for each generation:

```json
{
  "brand": "Brand name",
  "tone": "From brand-context.json or inferred from brief",
  "visualStyle": "From brand-context.json or 'professional brand content'",
  "hookText": "From brand-context or config",
  "cta": "From brand-context or config",
  "targetAudience": "From brand-context or inferred",
  "assets": ["list of generated files"],
  "script": "Voiceover script if available"
}
```

### Step 2: Generate Platform Copy

For EACH generated asset, produce copy for every relevant platform. Use Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) for generation quality.

Generate each platform file by calling Claude with the brand context and the specific output schema. Use this system prompt:

```
You are a social media copywriter and content strategist. Given brand context and asset details, generate platform-specific copy. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the exact schema provided. No markdown fences, no explanatory text.

Rules:
- Never use generic filler ("In today's fast-paced world...", "Are you tired of...")
- Every post opens with a hook that creates curiosity, urgency, or emotion
- Hashtags must be realistic and platform-appropriate — mix of large (1M+ posts), medium (100K-1M), and niche (<100K)
- Monetization mentions feel natural, never salesy
- Each platform follows its own conventions, character limits, and culture
- Ad copy variants test different psychological angles (benefit vs curiosity vs urgency vs social proof)
- Email subjects are short and curiosity-driven, never clickbait
```

### Step 3: Save Output Files

Save all files to `projects/{name}/output/copy/`. Each platform gets its own JSON file.

#### instagram.json

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-square.jpg",
      "caption": "Hook in the first line (this shows before '...more'). 100-300 words with intentional line breaks for readability. Story or insight that connects to the brand. End with a clear CTA (save this, share with a friend, link in bio).",
      "hashtags": [
        "#niche_specific_tag",
        "#medium_reach_tag",
        "#broad_category_tag"
      ],
      "cta": "Save this for your next [relevant moment]"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for Instagram:
- First line IS the hook — it must stop the scroll before the fold
- 15-20 hashtags: ~5 large (1M+), ~8 medium (100K-1M), ~5 niche (<100K)
- Use line breaks for readability, not walls of text
- End every caption with a CTA: save, share, comment, or link in bio
- Research hashtags via web search — never guess popularity tiers

#### tiktok.json

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1.mp4",
      "caption": "Short, punchy, conversational. Under 150 chars.",
      "onScreenText": [
        { "time": "0-2s", "text": "Hook overlay — first thing viewers see" },
        { "time": "2-5s", "text": "Key point or surprising fact" },
        { "time": "5-end", "text": "CTA or punchline" }
      ],
      "hashtags": ["#trending_tag", "#niche_tag"],
      "soundSuggestion": "Trending audio idea that fits the mood and niche"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for TikTok:
- Caption under 150 chars — the video does the talking
- On-screen text is crucial: hook in first 2 seconds or lose the viewer
- 5-8 hashtags only, mix trending + niche
- Sound suggestion should reference actual trending audio categories
- Conversational, raw, slightly unpolished tone — polished = corporate = scroll past

#### linkedin.json

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-landscape.jpg",
      "post": "Hook in first 2 lines (shows before '...see more'). 150-300 words. Use the Story-Lesson-CTA framework: open with a personal/brand story, extract a professional insight, close with engagement prompt. Professional but human — not corporate robot.",
      "hashtags": ["#IndustryTerm", "#ThoughtLeadership", "#BrandName"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for LinkedIn:
- First 2 lines must hook before the fold
- 3-5 hashtags max — LinkedIn penalizes hashtag spam
- Story-Lesson-CTA framework works best
- Professional tone but with personality — not stiff corporate speak
- Questions at the end drive comments

#### twitter.json

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-landscape.jpg",
      "tweet": "Under 280 chars. Sharp, opinionated, or surprising. No hashtags in the tweet body — they kill engagement on X.",
      "thread": [
        "1/ Thread opener if content warrants a thread. Hook in tweet 1.",
        "2/ Value or insight per tweet. Keep each under 280 chars.",
        "3/ Final tweet: CTA + link. 'Follow for more [topic]' or 'Link in bio'."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for Twitter/X:
- No hashtags in the tweet body — they reduce engagement on X
- Threads only when content genuinely warrants multiple tweets
- Sharp, opinionated takes outperform safe generic posts
- Thread hook (tweet 1) must stand alone as a great tweet

#### youtube.json

```json
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "assetFile": "final-video.mp4",
      "title": "Under 60 chars. Front-load keywords. Create curiosity gap.",
      "description": "First 2 lines: keywords + hook (shows in search results). 100-200 words total. Include relevant links. End with CTA to subscribe/like.",
      "tags": ["keyword_1", "keyword_2", "long_tail_keyword"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for YouTube:
- Title: keywords first, curiosity second, under 60 chars
- Description: first 2 lines show in search — make them count
- 10-15 tags mixing broad terms and long-tail keywords
- Tags should be researched via web search for the niche

#### ads.json

```json
{
  "variants": [
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-landscape.jpg",
      "angle": "benefit",
      "headline": "Under 40 chars — lead with the transformation or benefit",
      "body": "Under 125 chars — urgency, social proof, or curiosity",
      "cta": "Shop Now | Learn More | Get Started | Try Free"
    },
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-landscape.jpg",
      "angle": "curiosity",
      "headline": "Under 40 chars — open a curiosity loop",
      "body": "Under 125 chars — hint at what they'll discover",
      "cta": "See How"
    },
    {
      "assetFile": "scene-1-landscape.jpg",
      "angle": "social-proof",
      "headline": "Under 40 chars — lead with numbers or testimonial",
      "body": "Under 125 chars — specific result or transformation",
      "cta": "Join 10K+ Others"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for ads:
- Generate at least 3 variants per asset testing different angles
- Angles: benefit, curiosity, urgency, social proof, fear of missing out
- Headlines under 40 chars — benefit-driven
- Body under 125 chars — creates urgency or curiosity
- CTA must be a clear imperative action

#### email-sequence.json

```json
{
  "emails": [
    {
      "day": 0,
      "type": "welcome",
      "subject": "Short, curiosity-driven subject line",
      "preheader": "Extends the subject, creates more intrigue",
      "body": "Welcome + deliver immediate value. Introduce the brand story. Set expectations for what's coming. Light CTA.",
      "cta": "Specific action with clear benefit"
    },
    {
      "day": 2,
      "type": "value",
      "subject": "Educational or insight-driven subject",
      "preheader": "Tease the value inside",
      "body": "Pure value — teach something useful, share an insight, or tell a story. Build trust and authority. No hard sell.",
      "cta": "Soft engagement — reply, read more, try a tip"
    },
    {
      "day": 5,
      "type": "soft-pitch",
      "subject": "Social proof or results-focused subject",
      "preheader": "Hint at transformation",
      "body": "Social proof: customer results, testimonials, before/after. Introduce the offer naturally. Benefits over features.",
      "cta": "Check it out — low-pressure CTA"
    },
    {
      "day": 7,
      "type": "urgency",
      "subject": "Scarcity or deadline-driven subject",
      "preheader": "Last chance framing",
      "body": "Create real urgency (limited time, limited stock, price increase). Recap the key benefit. Final strong CTA.",
      "cta": "Strong imperative — Get yours before [deadline]"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### lead-magnet.json

```json
{
  "title": "Compelling name that promises specific, tangible value",
  "format": "pdf | checklist | template | video | swipe-file",
  "description": "What it contains and why someone would trade their email for it",
  "landingCTA": "Link-in-bio text that drives downloads",
  "contentOutline": [
    "Section 1: Quick win that proves your expertise",
    "Section 2: Framework or process they can follow",
    "Section 3: Templates or tools they can use immediately",
    "Section 4: Next steps that lead to your paid offer"
  ]
}
```

#### all-copy.json

Combine all of the above into a single file:

```json
{
  "projectName": "{name}",
  "generatedAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "brand": "Brand name",
  "instagram": { ... },
  "tiktok": { ... },
  "linkedin": { ... },
  "twitter": { ... },
  "youtube": { ... },
  "ads": { ... },
  "emailSequence": { ... },
  "leadMagnet": { ... }
}
```

### Step 4: Hashtag Research

This is critical — never guess hashtags. For each platform, use web search:

- Search `"{niche}" instagram hashtags 2026` — find actually-used tags with real post counts
- Search `"{niche}" tiktok trending hashtags` — find current trending tags
- Search `"{niche}" linkedin hashtags` — find professional community tags

Categorize each hashtag by reach:
- Large (1M+ posts): broad discovery
- Medium (100K-1M): category-level
- Niche (<100K): targeted community

### Step 5: Quality Checklist

Before saving, verify every piece of copy against these rules:

- [ ] No generic filler openings
- [ ] Every post starts with a hook
- [ ] Character limits respected per platform
- [ ] Hashtags are researched, not guessed
- [ ] Ad copy has multiple angle variants
- [ ] Email sequence follows value-before-pitch arc
- [ ] Lead magnet promises specific, tangible value
- [ ] CTAs are specific actions, not vague ("learn more" is weak, "get your free guide" is strong)
- [ ] Brand voice is consistent across platforms but adapted to each platform's culture

### Step 6: Report and Auto-Chain

Show what was generated:

```
Copy generated for all platforms:
  - instagram.json ({N} posts)
  - tiktok.json ({N} posts)
  - linkedin.json ({N} posts)
  - twitter.json ({N} posts)
  - youtube.json ({N} videos)
  - ads.json ({N} variants)
  - email-sequence.json (4 emails)
  - lead-magnet.json
```

Then offer the next step naturally: "Want me to package these into platform-ready folders with a posting schedule?"

If the user says "looks good" or similar, treat as implicit interest in packaging.
