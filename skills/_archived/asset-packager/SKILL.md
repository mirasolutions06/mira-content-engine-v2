# Asset Packager

You organize all generated content (images, videos, copy) into platform-ready packages that someone can immediately start posting from. Every file is renamed for clarity, matched with its copy, and organized by platform.

## Session Awareness

When invoked:
1. Check what exists in the project directory (config.json, output/, output/copy/, deliverables/)
2. If deliverables/ already exists, ask: "Repackage from scratch, or update with new assets?"
3. If copy doesn't exist, suggest running copy engine first (or offer assets-only packaging)
4. If output/ is empty, suggest running the pipeline first

Key files: config.json, cache/brand-context.json, output/, output/copy/

## Prerequisites

Before running, verify these exist:

**Required:**
- `projects/{name}/output/` — must contain at least some generated assets (images, clips, or video)

**Required for full packaging:**
- `projects/{name}/output/copy/` — copy files from the copy engine. If missing, tell the user: "No copy files found. Say 'write copy' or 'run step 3' first to generate captions and post text."

**Optional but used if available:**
- `projects/{name}/config.json` — for brand name, format info
- `projects/{name}/cache/brand-context.json` — for brand name and tone

If copy doesn't exist, offer two options:
1. "Run the copy engine first, then package" (recommended)
2. "Package assets without copy — just organize and rename files" (assets-only mode)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Inventory All Outputs

Scan the project directory and catalog everything:

```
projects/{name}/
├── output/
│   ├── images/           → brand images (scene-{N}-{format}.jpg)
│   ├── clips/            → video clips (scene-{N}.mp4)
│   ├── audio/            → voiceover.mp3
│   ├── copy/             → all JSON copy files
│   └── *.mp4             → final rendered video
├── assets/
│   ├── storyboard/       → storyboard frames (reference only, don't package)
│   ├── brand/            → logo, brand.json, fonts
│   └── audio/            → music.mp3, music-attribution.txt
```

Build an inventory object:

```json
{
  "brand": "Brand name from config/brand-context",
  "images": ["scene-1-story.jpg", "scene-1-square.jpg", "scene-1-landscape.jpg", ...],
  "clips": ["scene-1.mp4", "scene-2.mp4", ...],
  "video": "final-video-timestamp.mp4 or null",
  "voiceover": "voiceover.mp3 or null",
  "music": "music.mp3 or null",
  "musicAttribution": "music-attribution.txt or null",
  "logo": "logo.png or null",
  "copyFiles": ["instagram.json", "tiktok.json", ...],
  "mode": "video | brand-images | full"
}
```

### Step 2: Create Deliverables Structure

Build this directory tree under `projects/{name}/deliverables/`:

```
deliverables/
├── instagram/
│   ├── feed/
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-feed-01-square.jpg
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-feed-01-caption.txt
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-feed-02-square.jpg
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-feed-02-caption.txt
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── stories/
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-story-01.jpg
│   │   ├── {brand}-ig-story-02.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── reels/
│       ├── {brand}-ig-reel-01.mp4
│       ├── {brand}-ig-reel-01-caption.txt
│       └── ...
├── tiktok/
│   ├── {brand}-tiktok-01.mp4
│   ├── {brand}-tiktok-01-caption.txt
│   └── ...
├── linkedin/
│   ├── {brand}-linkedin-01-landscape.jpg
│   ├── {brand}-linkedin-01-post.txt
│   └── ...
├── youtube/
│   ├── {brand}-youtube-short-01.mp4
│   ├── {brand}-youtube-metadata.json
│   └── ...
├── ads/
│   ├── {brand}-ad-16x9.mp4
│   ├── {brand}-ad-1x1.mp4
│   ├── {brand}-ad-copy.json
│   └── ...
├── email/
│   ├── email-sequence.json
│   └── lead-magnet-brief.json
├── brand-assets/
│   ├── logo.png (if exists)
│   ├── brand-colors.json
│   └── music-attribution.txt (if music was used)
├── posting-schedule.md
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Match Assets to Copy

For each platform's copy JSON file, pair assets with their corresponding text:

**Instagram:**
- `scene-{N}-square.jpg` → feed posts (pair with instagram.json posts)
- `scene-{N}-story.jpg` → stories (no caption needed, visual only)
- Final video or clips → reels (pair with instagram.json reel captions)

**TikTok:**
- Final video or individual clips → TikTok posts
- Pair each with tiktok.json caption + hashtags

**LinkedIn:**
- `scene-{N}-landscape.jpg` → LinkedIn posts
- Pair with linkedin.json post text + hashtags

**YouTube:**
- Final video → YouTube Shorts
- Pair with youtube.json title, description, tags

**Ads:**
- All format variants → ad platform
- Pair with ads.json headline/body/CTA variants

**Email:**
- Copy email-sequence.json and lead-magnet.json directly

**For each asset-copy pair, create a plain text caption file:**
```
{brand}-ig-feed-01-caption.txt contents:

### Step 4: Generate Posting Schedule

Create `deliverables/posting-schedule.md`:

```markdown
# Posting Schedule: {Brand}

Generated: {date}
Content pieces: {total count}

## Week 1

| Day | Time | Platform | File | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|------|------|-------|
| Mon | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-feed-01-square.jpg | Feed post | Lead with strongest visual. Hook: "{hookText}" |
| Mon | 9-11am | LinkedIn | linkedin-01-landscape.jpg | Post | Cross-post adapted for professional audience |
| Mon | 12-2pm | Twitter/X | (link to IG post) | Tweet | Drive traffic to Instagram post |
| Tue | 6-9pm | TikTok | tiktok-01.mp4 | Video | Hook in first 2 seconds. Peak engagement window |
| Tue | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-story-01.jpg | Story | Behind-the-scenes or teaser for feed post |
| Wed | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-feed-02-square.jpg | Feed post | Second strongest visual |
| Wed | 11am-1pm | LinkedIn | linkedin-02-landscape.jpg | Post | Different angle from Monday |
| Thu | 6-9pm | TikTok | tiktok-02.mp4 | Video | Build on Monday's content |
| Thu | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-story-02.jpg | Story | Engagement prompt or poll |
| Fri | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-reel-01.mp4 | Reel | Full video content, highest production value |
| Fri | 12-2pm | YouTube | youtube-short-01.mp4 | Short | Cross-post reel with YouTube metadata |

## Week 2

| Day | Time | Platform | File | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|------|------|-------|
| Mon | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-feed-03-square.jpg | Feed post | Product detail or lifestyle shot |
| Mon | 9-11am | LinkedIn | linkedin-03-landscape.jpg | Post | Industry insight angle |
| Tue | 6-9pm | TikTok | tiktok-03.mp4 | Video | Respond to any engagement from week 1 |
| Wed | 8-10am | Email | email-1-welcome | Welcome email | Send to new subscribers from week 1 traffic |
| Thu | 8-10am | Instagram | ig-feed-04-square.jpg | Feed post | CTA-focused, drive to link in bio |
| Fri | 8-10am | Email | email-2-value | Value email | Build trust before pitch |

## Posting Best Practices

- **Instagram**: Best times 8-10am and 6-8pm. Feed posts Tue-Fri, Reels Fri-Sat.
- **TikTok**: Best times 6-9pm. Post when your audience is scrolling, not working.
- **LinkedIn**: Best times 9-11am Tue-Thu. Professional content for business hours.
- **Twitter/X**: Best times 12-2pm. Use to amplify other platform content.
- **YouTube Shorts**: Consistent daily posting drives the algorithm. Cross-post from TikTok/Reels.
- **Email**: Send welcome immediately on signup. Space follow-ups 2-3 days apart.
```

Adapt the schedule based on:
- How many assets were actually generated (don't schedule assets that don't exist)
- The project mode (brand-images only = no video slots)
- Platform conventions for the niche (research via web search if needed)

### Step 5: Generate Asset Manifest CSV

Create `deliverables/asset-manifest.csv` for bulk uploading to scheduling tools (Buffer, Later, Hootsuite, Publer — most accept CSV imports).

One row per asset:

```csv
filename,platform,type,dimensions,duration,caption_file,posting_day,posting_time,hashtags
glowlab-ig-feed-01-square.jpg,instagram,feed,1080x1080,,glowlab-ig-feed-01-caption.txt,Mon,08:00,"#OrganicSkincare #CleanBeauty #GlowLab"
glowlab-ig-story-01.jpg,instagram,story,1080x1920,,,,
glowlab-ig-reel-01.mp4,instagram,reel,1080x1920,20s,glowlab-ig-reel-01-caption.txt,Fri,08:00,"#SkincareRoutine #GlowUp"
glowlab-tiktok-01.mp4,tiktok,video,1080x1920,20s,glowlab-tiktok-01-caption.txt,Tue,18:00,"#skincare #fyp #glowlab"
glowlab-linkedin-01-landscape.jpg,linkedin,post,1920x1080,,glowlab-linkedin-01-post.txt,Mon,09:00,"#CleanBeauty #Skincare"
glowlab-youtube-short-01.mp4,youtube,short,1080x1920,20s,,Fri,12:00,
glowlab-ad-16x9.mp4,ads,video-ad,1920x1080,20s,,,
```

Fields:
- `filename` — the renamed deliverable file
- `platform` — instagram, tiktok, linkedin, twitter, youtube, ads
- `type` — feed, story, reel, video, post, tweet, short, video-ad
- `dimensions` — WxH in pixels (1080x1080 for square, 1080x1920 for story/reel, 1920x1080 for landscape)
- `duration` — video length in seconds, empty for images
- `caption_file` — path to the matching caption .txt file, empty if none
- `posting_day` — from the posting schedule
- `posting_time` — from the posting schedule (24h format)
- `hashtags` — comma-separated within quotes, from the copy files

### Step 6: Zip Archives (Optional)

After creating the deliverables folder, ask the user:

```
Create zip archives? Useful for sending to clients or uploading to scheduling tools.
  - "Yes, per platform" — creates instagram.zip, tiktok.zip, linkedin.zip, etc.
  - "Yes, full package" — creates one {brand}-full-package.zip with everything
  - "Yes, both" — per-platform zips + full package zip
  - "No" — skip, just the folder structure
```

If yes, create archives using the `zip` command:

**Per-platform archives:**
```bash
cd projects/{name}/deliverables
zip -r {brand}-instagram.zip instagram/
zip -r {brand}-tiktok.zip tiktok/
zip -r {brand}-linkedin.zip linkedin/
zip -r {brand}-youtube.zip youtube/
zip -r {brand}-ads.zip ads/
zip -r {brand}-email.zip email/
```

**Full package archive:**
```bash
cd projects/{name}
zip -r deliverables/{brand}-full-package.zip deliverables/ \
  -x "deliverables/*.zip"
```

The full package includes posting-schedule.md, README.md, asset-manifest.csv, and all platform folders. Exclude other zip files to avoid nesting.

### Step 7: Generate README

Create `deliverables/README.md`:

```markdown
# {Brand} Content Package

**Generated:** {date}
**Mode:** {video | brand-images | full}
**Format:** {youtube-short | tiktok | ad-16x9 | ad-1x1 | web-hero}

## What's Included

- {X} Instagram posts (feed + stories + reels)
- {X} TikTok videos with captions
- {X} LinkedIn posts with images
- {X} Twitter/X posts
- {X} YouTube Shorts with metadata
- {X} Ad creative variants
- 4-email welcome sequence
- Lead magnet concept
- Posting schedule (2 weeks)
- Brand assets (logo, colors)

## How to Use

1. Open the platform folder you want to post on
2. Each asset has a matching `-caption.txt` file — copy the text when posting
3. Follow `posting-schedule.md` for optimal timing
4. Start with Instagram and TikTok for maximum reach
5. Use the email sequence after setting up your landing page

## File Naming Convention

`{brand}-{platform}-{type}-{number}.{ext}`

Examples:
- `glowlab-ig-feed-01-square.jpg` — Instagram feed post, scene 1
- `glowlab-tiktok-01.mp4` — TikTok video, scene 1
- `glowlab-ig-feed-01-caption.txt` — Caption for the matching image

## Notes

- All images are AI-generated. Review before posting.
- Video clips use Kling AI. Minor artifacts are normal.
- Hashtags were researched but should be verified for your specific account.
- Email copy assumes a welcome/nurture sequence — customize the CTA links.
- Music attribution is in `brand-assets/music-attribution.txt` if background music was used.
```

### Step 8: Report and Auto-Chain

Show the deliverables summary:

```
Deliverables packaged in projects/{name}/deliverables/

  instagram/  — {X} feed posts, {X} stories, {X} reels
  tiktok/     — {X} videos with captions
  linkedin/   — {X} posts with images
  youtube/    — {X} shorts with metadata
  ads/        — {X} creative variants
  email/      — 4-email sequence + lead magnet brief

  posting-schedule.md — 2-week content calendar
  README.md           — package overview and instructions

Total files: {N}
```

Then offer the next step naturally: "Want monetization strategies and affiliate links for this niche?"
